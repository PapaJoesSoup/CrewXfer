{"name":"Kerbal Crew Transfer","tagline":"A KSP mod for moving kerbals between modules","body":"Kerbal Crew Transfer\r\n====================\r\n\r\nCrew Transfer is a mod for Kerbal Space Program, that allows players to transfer\r\nKerbals between modules in the same manner as they would transfer fuel.\r\n\r\nIt has optional support for Connected Living Spaces, another Mod/API that it\r\ncan use to determine whether two modules are connected before allowing the\r\nplayer to transfer kerbals between them. In other words, no more moving Kerbals\r\nthrough 42 feet of steel girder.\r\n\r\nCrew Transfer needs ModuleManager to work.\r\n\r\n[Forum Thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82101-0-23-5-Kerbal-Crew-Transfer)\r\n\r\n[Curse Page](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/221046-kerbal-crew-transfer#other-downloads;t1:other-downloads)\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Joe Davis.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
