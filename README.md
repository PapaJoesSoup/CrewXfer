Kerbal Crew Transfer
====================

Crew Transfer is a mod for Kerbal Space Program, that allows players to transfer
Kerbals between modules in the same manner as they would transfer fuel.

It has optional support for Connected Living Spaces, another Mod/API that it
can use to determine whether two modules are connected before allowing the
player to transfer kerbals between them. In other words, no more moving Kerbals
through 42 feet of steel girder.

Crew Transfer needs ModuleManager to work.
